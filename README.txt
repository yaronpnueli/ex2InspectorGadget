Walkthrough:
Change the first parameter (health) to 10000 ("It's over 9000!")
Jump_height - 25
Walk_speed - 17
Fall_speed - 0.5
Shooting_angle - 0
Shooting_speed - 50
choose whichever keys are comfortable for you.
Arm_img - ImageArm
Hand_img - ImageHand
Shot_obj - Bullet

The health and varying jump speed is enough, but lets try to do it without getting hit - 
Jump, and go right all the way.
Falling slowly, keep to the left the moment you are lower than the wall on your left.
Shoot the enemy.
Change jump_height to 10.
Go next to the spikes, then jump and go right all the way.
Change jump_height to 15.
jump, shoot the enemies. Jump on the platform, and go right and down.
Tada! You have won! :D
